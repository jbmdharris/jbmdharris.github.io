<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------
So, you decided to take a look under the hood here and see what kind
of code I write didn't you? Of course you did! It's what I do when I
review anyone's resume too. :)

A couple of things here. This is a simple website. It's one page and
I am one who believes in simplicity. Could I have written this with
template engines and JavaScript frameworks and such... sure.
But really, that's overkill for this kind of site now isn't it?
You'll notice that with exception of Google Analytics, there is no
JavaScript. I also didn't use a CSS framework or preprocessor.
That's the KISS principle at work. Are those valuable tools?
Absolutely! Just not for one page.

This means you won't see here how I format my AMD modules or
jQuery logic. You also won't see how I'm coming along learning
something like React that we've started to encorporate into our
product replacing Dojo. However, what you will notice here is
minimal, semantic, accessible HTML5 with some flexbox. Nothing
too fancy. Go ahead... run a screen reader on it or turn on
High Contrast accessibility mode and see what you think. If
you're reading this on a mobile device, you'll see there's
responsive design going on too.

This site is simple because all my heavy thinking is going into
my day job. And if I join your team, that's the way it will be
then too... using whatever frameworks and tooling you use...
because I can learn anything if I don't know it already.

      can be with all their marketing speak, you didn't come here for that.
      You came here to see what I'm really made of, how I work with other people and to answer the question
      <q>How can this guy help me and my business get stuff done?</q> I'm so glad you asked.
      Pull up a chair and grab a beverage of your choice and let's chat for a bit.

      <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I've worked on many things over the years... and I'd bore you to tears if I told you about them all.
      So, let me just share a few stories that will help you get to know me better and how I work with my team.
      </p>

      </p>

      
      <!-- ============================================ -->
      <h2>Ancient History</h2>
      <p>I've worked on server-side code and back-end code and application code and
      application builder code throughout the years. This gives me a large surface area
      of experience to bring to your team.
      <br />

        <img src="images/history/WebSpherePortal.png" alt="WebSphere Portal Server" />
        <img src="images/history/WebSphereStudio.png" alt="WebSphere Studio" />

      </div>
      </p>
      

      <!-- ============================================ -->
      <h2>Endorsements</h2>
      <p>I'm a team player. I really like it when my team is empowered and thriving.
      And I take great joy in helping them get there. Want to know what my co-workers think of me?
      Don't take my word for it... let's ask them. My most recent endorsements are of course on my
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbmdharris" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.
      But there are some others that make more sense to share here.
      </p>

      <h3>Here I come to save the day!</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="epic" src="images/endorsements/HereIcomeToSaveTheDay.png" alt="Me as 'Mighty Mouse'" />
        <br/>
        OK, yes, this is a bit silly... but I love it.
        This Photoshop of me as "Mighty Mouse" came in an instant message from one of my collegues
        who I helped through a really complicated technical problem. Now, in that particular job,
        I tended to take care of the complicated JavaScript and Java coding so that my collegue could
        hammer out hardcore HTML5 and CSS without worrying about that stuff. Over time in that role,
        I got this picture sent to me a lot.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Worth your weight in gold</h3>      
      <p>
        <img class="epic" src="images/endorsements/DontForgetWhyYouAreHere.png" alt="Screen capture of email: Michael, I don't know how much you weigh, bu you are easily worth your weight in gold." />
        <br/>
        Well, this note really isn't the reason I weigh a little more than I should... but the sentiment
        is greatly appreciated. Tom and I were coordinating work across multiple teams in multiple
        divisions of our company and I was able to get everyone on the same page and all the buy-in we
        needed through technical contacts I had.
      </p>

      <h3>We need you</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="epic" src="images/endorsements/WeNeedYou.jpg" alt="Framed picture of post-it note: Michael, We need you. Carol" />
        <br/>
        Yes, that is a framed post-it note. It lives on my desk where I can see it every day.
        You know, everyone has a difficult day at work from time-to-time.
        Sometimes you have a few difficult days in a row.
        As my Father said, <q>If it were fun all the time it would be called 'play' now wouldn't it?</q>
        When those times come, it is helpful to have something that reminds you of how great working
        with wonderful people can be. Carol was one of those wonderful people and I did have a fantastic
        work experience with her when she was Chief Architect of a product I was on. I had and still
        have great respect for her and in my down moment, she wanted me to know that I was essential.
      </p>
