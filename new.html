<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------
So, you decided to take a look under the hood here and see what kind
of code I write didn't you? Of course you did! It's what I do when I
review anyone's resume too. :) Don't forget to check out the comments
in the CSS file as well.

A couple of things here. This is a simple website. It's one page and
I am one who believes in simplicity. Could I have written this with
template engines and JavaScript frameworks and such... sure.
But really, that's overkill for this kind of site now isn't it?
You'll notice that with exception of Google Analytics, there is no
JavaScript. I also didn't use a CSS framework or preprocessor.
That's the KISS principle at work. Are those valuable tools?
Absolutely! Just not for one page.

This means you won't see here how I format my AMD modules or
jQuery logic. You also won't see how I'm coming along learning
something like React that we've started to incorporate into our
product replacing Dojo. However, what you will notice here is
minimal, semantic, accessible HTML5 with some flexbox. Nothing
too fancy. Go ahead... run a screen reader on it or turn on
High Contrast accessibility mode and see what you think. If
you're reading this on a mobile device, you'll see there's
responsive design going on too.

This site is simple because all my heavy thinking is going into
my day job. And if I join your team, that's the way it will be
then too... using whatever frameworks and tooling you use...
because I can learn anything if I don't know it already.

      <p>I'm a Front-end web developer with 25+ years of experience successfully creating outstanding content,
      delivering innovative products, and leading empowered teams.</p>
      
      <p>There's a lot of great information about me in my

      however, you didn't come to this site for that. And I won't repeat any of it here... so
      be sure to check those out if you haven't already. This space is different. I want
      you to be able to really get to know me here. What am I really made of? How do I work
      with other people? What am I passionate about? I'm so glad you asked.
      Pull up a chair and grab a beverage of your choice and let's chat for a bit.

      <p>Stories are what help us understand one another better. Here are a few
      stories I've chosen to share with you here so you can really get to know me in a way that you

      <!-- ============================================ -->
      <h2>Ancient History</h2>
      <p>In addition to all the web and front-end code I've worked on in recent years,
      I've also worked on everything from server-side code to application code to
      application builder code to operating system code.
      This gives me a broad surface area of experience to bring to your team.
      One thing that has been constant throughout my career though... I've always
      worked with wonderful designers and over the years I have absorbed a
      lot about how the design process works. On the rare occasion that I wasn't
      working with a designer, I did the designs on my own. And even when
      I was working with a designer (or even a team of designers), I got to
      flex my design muscle a bit too.

      <!-- ============================================ -->
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p>I'm a team player. I really like it when my team is empowered and thriving.
      And I take great joy in helping them get there. Want to know what my co-workers think of me?
      Don't take my word for it... let's ask them. My most recent recommendations are of course on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbmdharris" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
      But there are some others that make more sense to share here.
      </p>

      <h3>Here I come to save the day!</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="rpic" src="images/endorsements/HereIcomeToSaveTheDay.png" alt="Me as 'Mighty Mouse'" />
        <br/>
        I so love this one.
        This Photoshop of me as "Mighty Mouse" came in an instant message from one of my colleagues 
        who I helped through a really complicated technical problem. Now, in that particular job,
        I tended to take care of the complicated JavaScript and Java coding so that my colleague could
        power through massive amounts of new HTML and CSS without worrying about complicated
        framework stuff. Over time in that role, I got this picture sent to me a lot.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Worth your weight in gold</h3>      
      <p>
        <img class="rpic" src="images/endorsements/DontForgetWhyYouAreHere.png" alt="Screen capture of email: Michael, I don't know how much you weigh, bu you are easily worth your weight in gold." />
        <br/>
        Well, this note really isn't the reason I weigh a little more than I should... but the sentiment
        is greatly appreciated. Tom and I were coordinating work across multiple teams in our company
        and I was able to get everyone on the same page. I meticulously pay attention to details and
        am quite organized. It's the only way to get things done.
      </p>

      <h3>We need you</h3>
      <p>
        <img class="rpic" src="images/endorsements/WeNeedYou.jpg" alt="Framed picture of post-it note: Michael, We need you. Carol" />
        <br/>
        Yes, that is a framed post-it note. It lives on my desk where I can see it every day.
        It was written by a Chief Architect I worked for who has now retired.
        I had (and still have) great respect for this person.
        It not only reminds me that all the work I do really matters, but also that I
        need to encourage those around me so they know their work really matters too. 
      </p>
