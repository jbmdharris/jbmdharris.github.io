/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
So, you decided to take a look under the hood here and see what kind
of code I write didn't you? Of course you did! It's what I do when I
review anyone's resume too. :) Don't forget to check out the comments
in the HTML file as well.

For this site I chose not to use a CSS preprocessor. I'm also not
using reset styles either. This site is simple... it doesn't need
much. So, I'm keeping the CSS simple. The only thing from a
preprocessor that would be helpful here really would be nested
styles in a few places and maybe some color variables.

There's a lot of comments in here so you know what I'm doing. Of
course in a real production site this would all be minified. I will
go ahead and say now that I put all my CSS declarations on separate
lines because it makes diffs in source control systems easier to read.
